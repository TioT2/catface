; CATFACE ASM FILE

; bit of obvious ASM code.
; R64 type just represents 64-bit sequence with undefined type.
; instructions that operates on some (defined) stack data mainly
; will have 't_' (where t: r32/64, i32/64, f32/64) prefix
; any other instructions have no types (like halt/unreachable/syscall)

; syscall instruction is made to call some functions from outside of sandbox
; "syscall <- n" just outputs n interpreting it as f64 number
syscall 1
